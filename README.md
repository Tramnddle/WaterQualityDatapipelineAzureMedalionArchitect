Project Description

Business Overview

A well-incorporated pipeline is a critical data engineering practice designed to integrate data from various sources, such as on-premise databases, cloud-managed databases, CSV, XML, log files, Data Warehouses, and API endpoints. This data is transformed through a comprehensive data pipeline (cloud/on-premise), which is then used to generate meaningful insights for analytics.

Comprehensive data pipelines are fundamental for organizations aiming to efficiently manage large volumes of data, reducing manual intervention. By deploying such infrastructure, organizations can fully leverage their data to drive business growth. Applications of these pipelines span across industries, including e-commerce platforms, product companies, startups, and government agencies.

Key Features

Complex Workflow Handling: Seamless management of complex data workflows using cloud-based pipelines that offer scalability and robustness.

Data Quality Assurance: Implementation of medallion architecture in the Databricks workspace ensures data accuracy, cleaning, transformation, and outlier detection.

Data Extraction: Data is fetched from Azure-managed SQL Database and converted into a cohesive format.

Analysis Efficiency: High-quality, essential data is loaded into the final layer for visualization, minimizing overhead and enhancing performance.

Wide-ranging and thoroughly planned ETL pipelines apply predefined business rules and transformations to ensure high-quality outcomes, including logistics optimization, user engagement rate improvements, and predictive sales trend analysis. Azure servicesâ€™ integration facilitates data ingestion, transformation, and analysis with seamless connectivity and orchestration.

Aim

This project aims to analyze large water sensor datasets collected across European countries using Azure Services. The goal is to leverage Azure's capabilities to manage workflows, analyze raw data, and generate actionable insights while maintaining high standards of data management and pipeline efficiency.

Data Description

The dataset comprises over one million rows and 32 columns of water sensor data collected across various European countries. Key features include:

Country and Water Body Category

Determinands Information: Concentration levels (minimum, maximum, mean, and median) at specific timestamps

Quality Samples: Conducted vs. total samples for each observation

Each value is tied to a specific country and monitoring site, providing a detailed view of determinand content over time.

Approach

1. Data Extraction

Data was initially available in an Azure-managed SQL database bucket.

An Azure Logic App was created to pull data from the Azure-managed SQL Database.

2. Raw Data Storage

Azure Blob Storage was set up to store raw data from the SQL Server database.

Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS) Gen2 with hierarchical space enabled was created to store structured data.

3. Orchestration

Azure Data Factory orchestrated data movement from Azure Blob Storage to ADLS Gen2.

4. Data Transformation

The medallion architecture was implemented with three layers:

Bronze Layer: Raw data storage

Silver Layer: Cleaned and processed data

Gold Layer: High-quality, analysis-ready data

5. Visualization

Cleaned data was retrieved from a Hive metastore database.

Power BI was used to generate insights through advanced visualizations.

Benefits of Azure Services

Azure services provide integrated data management capabilities to streamline ingestion, transformation, and analysis. Key advantages include:

Seamless Connectivity: Across diverse data sources

Efficient Orchestration: Through Azure Data Factory

Durability and Availability: Ensuring stable and efficient pipeline performance

How to Use

Clone this repository to your local machine.

Ensure your Azure account and necessary services (SQL Database, Blob Storage, Data Factory, etc.) are set up.

Follow the steps outlined in the Approach section to replicate the pipeline setup.

Use Power BI to visualize the processed data.
